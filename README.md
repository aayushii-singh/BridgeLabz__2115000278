Feature- 04/02/25 - this,static,final,instanceof 
--this Keyword: Refers to the current object, resolves variable-method ambiguity, invokes class methods/constructors, and supports constructor chaining.
--static Keyword: Static members belong to the class, shared across objects, and static methods can't access instance variables or be overridden.
--final Keyword: Final variables can't be reassigned, methods can't be overridden, classes can't be extended, and its used for constants.
--instanceof Operator: Checks if an object is an instance of a class, prevents ClassCastException, and ensures correct object type. 

Feature- 05/02/25

--Sequence Diagram illustrates object interactions and message flow over time.
